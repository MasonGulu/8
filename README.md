This is a lua script intended for CC:T computers. It will prevent the user of a computer from being able to see, read, or write to protected files and directories.

The file is fairly well documented and there's some options at the top you can change. Be careful, once the computer you install it on reboots or runs the file you won't be able to edit it again easily.
